Hi, I’m @AdelineLaRue! I'm a stduent who codes in her free time!
I currently know html and css, and am working on learning javascript and python. 
I also have a Replit account (https://replit.com/@AdelineLaRue) so if you want to check out some of my stuff when I publish projects, you can go there. 
Si vous voulez me joindre, je peux parler francais aussi :)
